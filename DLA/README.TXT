Diffusion limited aggregation (DLA)

1. classical DLA 
A particle that diffuses sticks to a seed and so on.

2. finite reaction rate
As in classical DLA, but the particle sticks to the seed with probability p (for example p=1/8).

3. noise reduction
If a particle diffuses to the aggregate (to its perimeter) is terminated and so on, but in this point of contact there is a number counting the number of particles reached the point, if the number is greater then M the particle is not terminated but added to the aggregate.
